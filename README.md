# Ferad
Gulp Frontend for Humans

## About
Ferad is a JavaScript project management tool. It is built on the top of Gulp with the aim of maximizing web development productivity.
In its core, Ferad makes the configuration a first-class citizen, by providing ways to share, compose, override configuration options and build pipelines.

##Ferad's Objectives

###Accessibility
Make web development technologies easily accessible, by eliminating the burden of setup and configuration and integrating them under a unified interface.

###Abstraction over Boilerplate
Eliminate boilerplate by replacing it with single ferad.json, providing a single source of information about application's build and structure.
Free file space and mental resources to write actual code. Templating or code generation is for programs, not humans.

###Centralization Made Easy
Ferad is exclusively built to support complex JS projects, custom workflows and monolithic repositories.
It can easily manage shared source trees across multiple apps, build targets, profiles, technology stacks all under one project.
Ferad's high level, declarative configs makes project structure and both processes explicit and comprehensive.

## Status
Ferad is under active development with evolving design.
